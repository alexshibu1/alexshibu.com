## About

This is my personal corner of the internet where I document my journey from "ideas guy" to "actually ships things." I'm currently on a self-designed **builder gap year** — taking time to get dangerous at full-stack development, build cool projects, and figure out what I want to work on.

I'm a second-year student at the University of Toronto (Physics + CS + Economics), but I learn best by building. I've worked on startups, built AI tools for web3/healthcare/EdTech, and even tried my hand at NFTs (spoiler: learned a lot, didn't find product-market fit 😅).

When I'm not coding, you'll find me taking on fitness challenges, reviewing cafes ☕, or bringing together young people to drive change (hosted experiences for 600+ students).

**Current vibe:** Building Avalonn (voice agents for SMBs), exploring AI applications, and trying to ship 12 projects in 12 months.

## What's Inside

- **About** — My story, current focus, and what I'm working on
- **Projects** — The good, the bad, and the "what was I thinking?" experiments
- **Writing** — Thoughts, learnings, and reflections (sometimes coherent)
- **Reading** — Books and resources I'm actually using

---

## Tech Stack

Built with modern tools because life's too short for outdated tech:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** — React framework (because I like things fast)
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** — Type safety (saves me from myself)
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** — Utility-first CSS (move fast, break things less)
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** — Markdown + React (best of both worlds)
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** — Hosting (deploy in seconds, not hours)
