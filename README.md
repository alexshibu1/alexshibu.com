## About

This is my personal corner of the internet where I document my journey from "ideas guy" to "actually ships things."

I'm currently on a self-designed **builder year** focused on:
- 🚀 Getting dangerous at full-stack development + AI
- 📐 Deeply understanding physics and math
- 🧪 Building experiments and throwing potatoes at the wall

This site is where I park the experiments: small web apps, AI tools, and random rabbit holes that went too far.
