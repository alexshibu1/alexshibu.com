  <p>mid book for self-improvement imo</p>
  <p>the main part of book scares you about how the lack of sleep is literally killing you. This makes me want to tell everyone about the ideas.</p>
  <p>Not much more than the basic stuff on how to improve sleep quality.</p>
  <p>mind you I'm an average 19 year old with normal sleep patterns, i think? I was basically trying to sleep early to be honest and not at 1am and feel tired at 6</p>
  <p>we'll see if this worked. Andrew Huberman has more tips on specific stuff.</p>
  <p>I listened to the audio book then read the summary</p>
