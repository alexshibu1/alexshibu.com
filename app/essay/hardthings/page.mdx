Doing hard things suck  
But.. they make you feel like you can conquer anything.

I say a lot of shit..  
Ideas ideas ideas

A few weeks ago when I was inspired by Seth Cohen to do something like this cycling from Scarborough to Toronto.  
It did not for minute come to my mind how difficult it might be.

But doing it was hard.  
From the moment I did my first few pedals

Few insights.  
Anything can be conquered just by starting slowly.  
doing the first 3-5k means I'm never stopping.  
That’s the most danger part for failure, cuz your mind can give up.

I would compare it to a starting a fire.  
Ones the fire is small it can turn off very easily  
but the it’s at a certain range, it just growns by itself.  
Actually after a certain point, it’s also uncontrollable.  
It has a mind of its own.

The main reason I do shit like this is not because I have nothing to do with 6 hours of my life.  
Getting these wins early on in my life proves to me internally I can accomplish things I set my mind to.

THANK GOD I have mind that can reason properly and grow.  
Without this I would be nothing.

I ended up doing a 50K bike ride!
