<EssayHeader title="My Builder Gap Year" date="January 20, 2025" />
I’m a 21-year-old trying to turn that L into the best decision I’ve made.

## Before this

- I bounced between physics, compsci, and startups.
- Spent more time at coworking spaces and conferences than in class.
- Burned a few thousand dollars on flights, hackathons, and side projects that mostly didn’t make money (yet).
