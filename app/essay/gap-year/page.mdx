<EssayHeader title="My Builder Gap Year" date="January 20, 2025" />

I’m a 21-year-old builder currently on academic suspension from UofT, trying to turn that L into the best decision I’ve made.

I have ADHD, a bad habit of falling into rabbit holes, and an equally strong habit of signing up for things I’m barely qualified for.

## Before this

- I bounced between physics, compsci, and startups.
- Spent more time at coworking spaces and conferences than in class.
- Burned a few thousand dollars on flights, hackathons, and side projects that mostly didn’t make money (yet).
