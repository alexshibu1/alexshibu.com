Pretty repetitive advice, but if you like the general Navy Seals hard life stuff, it's great. I liked it. But nothing new. The idea of starting your day with a completed task, even if small is powerful. It makes you feel good and in motion. Some of his stories are awesome, but are not even relevant to the advice. Repeating the fundamentals really well is a good idea.
