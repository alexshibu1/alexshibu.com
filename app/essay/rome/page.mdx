I have nothing better to be doing but it is the best thing

For the past 1 hour, I been siting outside, under a pillar in the st Peters square.  
I don’t feel hungry, tiered or scared.  
I just feel defeated.

This morning I set out with a mission.  
To conquer Rome.

I went to the collsioum, then somewhere else, then Malayalam mass and by the time I figured out how to get here the basilica closed.

When trying to go in, the guy told me know but I didn’t try.  
I should have asked if I could still go in.

Now my flight leaves tomorrow.  
I don’t know what to do.

By being not risky to arrive 2 hours than, am I not being the type of person I want to be.  
Or am I being dumb.

I really wanted to see the top of the world.

Also all my bank cards are failing now so don’t quite know what to do.

_edit 2025: the story got wild after this_
