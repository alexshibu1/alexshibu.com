In the morning I made the dumb dumb dumb mistake

I put my money in GME.
The dumbest idea ever
All based on my first million episode about the roaring kitty being back

I sold stuff on wealth simple to save money for building

Then saw the options button

Bought and that’s when it all went wrong

Lost my money
320 cad.

I feel like a loser
lost my parents money

<br />
I'm a gambling addict
