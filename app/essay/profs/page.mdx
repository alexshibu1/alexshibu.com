Profs need coaches

CEO’s have coo coaches

Athletes have person trainers

Doctors have older doctors

But teachers don’t have teaching coaches to activity improve their skills

Back in grade threee my principle came to sit in on my teacher for 1 period

Why is that not a thing.

People who help them convey information better

Some of these profs at uni really suck man specially in teaching

In every other high-stakes job, there is some form of regular coaching or mentoring built into the system.

Teaching is just as important, but we mostly leave profs alone and hope they “figure it out” on their own.

If teachers had real teaching coaches the same way CEOs, athletes, and doctors do, students would actually feel the difference in how clearly things are explained and how much they learn.
